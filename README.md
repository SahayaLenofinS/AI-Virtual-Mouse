# AI-Virtual-Mouse
This project utilizes computer vision and hand tracking to create a virtual mouse control system. It allows users to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures captured from a webcam feed. The system detects hand movements, maps them to screen coordinates, and translates specific gestures into mouse actions, such as cursor movement and clicking.
